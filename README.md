# NAME

App::GHPT - A command line tool to simplify using Github and Pivotal Tracker for an agile workflow

# VERSION

version 1.000011

# SYNOPSIS

    # configure as per instructions below
    $> gh-pt.pl

# DESCRIPTION

This is a command line tool to help link together
[GitHub](https://github.com/) and [Pivotal
Tracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/). It helps enable a workflow combining
PT stories with pull requests.

The basic workflow is as follows:

1. Start a story in Pivotal Tracker. (Optional)
2. Hack, hack, hack.
3. Run this tool while you are in a git checkout. You should have the branch for
which you want to submit a PR currently checked out.

    Running this tool will do the following things for you:

    - Prompt you to select one of your active Pivotal Tracker stories, or
      create a new one.
    - Ask you a set of questions about the work you've done. The answers are
      included in your PR. The question generation can be customized by writing
      plugins. (Optional)
    - Create a pull request on GitHub for the repo you are currently in, with
      the PT story's title, URL, and description in the PR, a well as the
      optional questions & answers.
    - Add a comment on the PT story linking to the PR that was just created.
    - Change the PT story's status to "Delivered".

# SETUP

## hub

You should first set up `hub`. It's available at [https://hub.github.com](https://hub.github.com)
and has installation instructions there.

After installation, tell git config about it and check that it's working.

    git config --global --add hub.host github.com
    hub issue

(You'll need your GitHub and/or GHE credentials.)

## pt config

You'll also need to tell git about your PT account:

    git config --global submit-work.pivotaltracker.username thor
    git config --global submit-work.pivotaltracker.token ae158fa0dc6570c8403f04bd35738d81

Your actual username and token can be found at
[https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile).

# CREATING PULL REQUEST QUESTIONS

A question is a class which consumes the
[App::GHPT::WorkSubmitter::Role::Question](https://metacpan.org/pod/App::GHPT::WorkSubmitter::Role::Question) and implements a method named
`ask`. See that role's documentation for details.

By default, this tools looks for modules that have a a package name beginning
with `App::GHPT::WorkSubmitter::Question` to find question classes. However,
you can configure one or more alternative namespaces by setting the git config
key `submit-work.question-namespaces`. This should be a space-separated list
of namespaces under which questions can live.

# REQUESTER NAME IN PULL REQUESTS

By default, the name of the PT story's requester will be included in the pull
request text. This is helpful if you relay your project's PRs to Slack, as the
requester can get alerted when their name is used.

If you want to disable this, set the git config key
`submit-work.include-requester-name-in-pr` to `0`.

# COMMAND LINE OPTIONS

This tool accepts the following options:

## `--project "Project Name"`

The name of the PT project in which to look for or create stories. By default,
all projects are searched one at a time. If you have a lot of projects you may
want to limit this to just one.

The `--project` argument will be matched case insensitively against all PT
projects accessible to you.

You can also omit this option and specify the project name via the
`APP_GHPT_PROJECT` environment variable. It will be matched in the same
fashion as the command line option.

## `--base branch`

The branch against which the PR should be made. This defaults to the master
branch.

## `--dry-run`

Doesn't create a PR or a story, just prints out the body of the PR or story
that would have been created.

## `--create-story`

Instead of picking an existing story, create a new one.

## `--story-name "Story Name"`

The story name to use when creating a story.

## `--requester "Requester Name"`

The name of the PT requester to use in the PR description.

The `--requester` argument will be matched case insensitively against all PT
requesters accessible to you.

# TROUBLESHOOTING

## Bad Credentials

When hub is first used to connect to GitHub/GitHub Enterprise, hub requires a
name and password that it uses to generate an OAuth token and stores it in
`~/.config/hub`. If you have not used hub yet, this script will exit with:

    $ gh-pt.pl
    Error creating pull request: Unauthorized (HTTP 401)
    Bad credentials

The fix is to regenerate the OAuth token. Delete the `~/.config/hub` file if
you've got one, and then run a `hub` command manually, such as
`hub browse`. After authenticating, you should be able to use this script.

## "No started stories found"

If you get this message but you definitely have stories which are in the
"started" or "finished" states, then there's probably an error with your
configuration. Double check your PT username and token as seen on
[https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile) against what you see via `git
config --global --get-regexp '^submit-work'`

# BUGS

This requires 'hub' to be installed and configured.

A fatal error may occur if your branch exists locally, but you haven't pushed it yet.

You may also get a warning like below, but this shouldn't impact the creation of your pull request.

    Content-Length header value was wrong, fixed at /opt/perl5.20.2/lib/site_perl/5.20.2/LWP/Protocol/http.pm line 258, <> line 1.
