=head1 DESCRIPTION

This role allows you to write questions to ask someone when creating pull
request.

You want to create these questions classes in the
C<App::GHPT::WorkSubmitter::Question::*> namespace where
L<App::GHPT::WorkSubmitter::Questioner> will automatically detect them and ask
them each time C<gh-pt.pl> is run.

Each class must supply an C<ask> method which should prompt the user as needed
and return any markdown to be placed in the pull request body.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 changed_files

The files that have changed in this branch.  This is the primary attribute
you want to examine.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 $question->ask_question($question, @optional_responses)

Interactively ask a question and return markdown suitable for including in the
pull request body.

The question that should be asked must be passed as the first argument, and
all other arguments are treated as stock answers the user can select when
asked the question.  The user will also have a final option C<Launch Editor>
which will launch their editor and allow them free-form text input.
