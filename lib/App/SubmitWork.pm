# ABSTRACT: A command line tool to simplify using Github and Pivotal Tracker for an agile workflow

__END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a command line tool to help link together
L<GitHub|https://github.com/> and L<Pivotal
Tracker|https://www.pivotaltracker.com/>. It helps enable a workflow combining
PT stories with pull requests.

The basic workflow is as follows:

=over 4

=item 1.

Start a story in Pivotal Tracker.

=item 2.

Hack, hack, hack.

=item 3.

Run this tool, which will do the following things for you:

=over 8

=item *

Prompt you to select one of your active Pivotal Tracker stories.

=item *

(Optional)

Ask you a set of questions about the work you've done. The answers are
included in your PR. The question generation can be customized by writing
plugins.

=item *

Create a pull request on GitHub for the repo you are currently in, with the PT
story's title, URL, and description in the PR, a well as the optional
questions & answers.

=item *

Add a comment on the PT story linking to the PR that was just created.

=item *

Change the PT story's status to "Delivered".

=head1 SETUP

=head2 hub

You should first set up C<hub>. It's available at L<https://hub.github.com>
and has installation instructions there.

After installation, tell git config about it and check that it's working.

    git config --global --add hub.host github.com
    hub issue

(You'll need your GitHub and/or GHE credentials.)

=head2 pt config

You'll also need to tell git about your PT account:

    git config --global submit-work.pivotaltracker.username thor
    git config --global submit-work.pivotaltracker.token ae158fa0dc6570c8403f04bd35738d81

(Your actual token can be found at L<https://www.pivotaltracker.com/profile>)

=head1 TROUBLESHOOTING

=head2 Bad Credentials

When hub is first used to connect to GitHub/GitHub Enterprise, hub requires a
name and password that it uses to generate an OAuth token and stores it in
C<~/.config/hub>. If you have not used hub yet, this script will exit with:

    $ submit-work.pl --project minf
    Error creating pull request: Unauthorized (HTTP 401)
    Bad credentials

The fix is to regenerate the OAuth token. Delete the C<~/.config/hub> file if
you've got one, and then run a C<hub> command manually, such as
C<hub browse>. After authenticating, you should be able to use this script.

=head1 BUGS

This requires 'hub' to be installed and configured.

A fatal error may occur if your branch exists locally, but you haven't pushed it yet.

You may also get a warning like below, but this shouldn't impact the creation of your pull request.
